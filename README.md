# Raspi-Baby-Mobile

A Raspberry Piâ€“powered system that brings interactivity to a baby mobile.

It visually detects yaw movement of the head and translates it to a proportional rotation of a visual display.

## Background

Young infants rapidly learn that their own actions can "make things happen" around them, a capacity known as response-contingent learning.

In [Rovee-Colliers' 1969 experiment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022096569900253),
babies as young as two months had one of their legs connected via a ribbon to an overhead mobile.
When the attached leg was kicked, the mobile moved in direct response.
Results showed that already at this early age, the contingency between action and environmental changes are learned. 

Building on this, [Watson and Ramey](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1973-28652-001)
used a pressure-sensitive pillow wired to a rotating array of colored shapes.
Around 2 month old babys were placed with their heads on pressure-sensitive pillows.
They quickly adapted their posture to keep the display turning, again demonstrating an emerging sense of agency.

Crucially, contingent feedback elicited longer looking times and signs of positive affect (smiling, coo-ing, vocalizing) whereas identical but non-contingent movements evoked little interest.
